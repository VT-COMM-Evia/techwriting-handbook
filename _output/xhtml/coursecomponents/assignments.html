  <p class="p">You can post <a class="xref" href="../assignments/assignment_descriptions.html#concept_rfl_wzp_rw" title="While instructors are free to administer assignments they deem appropriate for their classes, there are different categories of assignments that typically work well for this course.">assignment descriptions</a> through the assignments feature in <a class="xref" href="../resources/lms.html#concept_oqy_5xp_rw" title="Virginia Tech uses and supports Canvas as its learning management system (LMS).">Canvas</a>. As with <a class="xref" href="exercises.html#concept_ln3_t1l_lx" title="Exercises are low-risk deliverables that allow students to learn the concepts and practice the craft of technical writing.">exercises</a>, there are different tools through
   which you can implement them. For example, you could interact with students through <a class="xref" href="../resources/google_docs.html#concept_gmt_hdd_dx" title="Google Docs allows students to write and format documents, share content, and collaborate with instructors and other students real time in an online environment.">Google Docs</a> to help them improve
   their work. However, keep in mind that assignments should measure a student's success with the
   corresponding material and thus be performed independently by the student.</p>
