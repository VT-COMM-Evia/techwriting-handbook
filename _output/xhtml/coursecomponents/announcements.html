  <p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../resources/lms.html#concept_oqy_5xp_rw" title="Virginia Tech uses and supports Canvas as its learning management system (LMS).">Canvas</a> includes an announcements
   feature that allows you to post messages for students. This feature is a particularly useful
   communication tool because students by default receive an email whenever an announcement is
   posted. This functionality allows you to use announcements as a way to send mass emails to your
   students.</p>

  <p class="p">In some cases, you might script announcements based on events you know will occur during the
   semester. For example, you might know that you want to remind students of upcoming deadlines or a
   holiday on which no lesson will be posted. If you script announcements like this ahead of time in
   Canvas, you can set the announcement to become available at a specified date and time.</p>

  <div class="p">While you will use announcements for almost anything you want to discuss with students, you
   should consider using announcements regularly for the following events:<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" id="concept_kjw_nyp_rw__simpletable_xgb_ljk_by" border="1" class="simpletable"><col style="width:20.491803278688526%" /><col style="width:79.50819672131148%" /><thead><tr class="sthead">

      available a day or two before the semester begins. At the end of the semester, you should post
      one final announcement to bring the class to an official end. These announcements should be in
      addition to the first and last lesson summaries. Since an email is also sent with these
      announcements, you could use them as the welcome and completion emails discussed in the class
