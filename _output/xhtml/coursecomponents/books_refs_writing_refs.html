  reference to help with basic concepts of writing, grammar, and punctuation.</p>

  <p class="p">In determining the requirements for a writing reference, you should remember that the students
   of this course are <strong class="ph b">not</strong> English or writing majors and therefore have different needs than
   those of an English or writing major. This means using a book that is both inexpensive and easy
   to follow for a non-writer. You should consider making a published writing reference optional,
   and point students toward free websites with which you are familiar and comfortable.</p>
