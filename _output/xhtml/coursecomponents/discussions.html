  <p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../resources/lms.html#concept_oqy_5xp_rw" title="Virginia Tech uses and supports Canvas as its learning management system (LMS).">Canvas</a> includes a discussions
   feature where students can hold conversations. It's up to you to determine how much you want to
   integrate discussions in your class, but remember that this feature in a way mimics conversations
   you would otherwise have in a face-to-face classroom. So it's a good way to have students discuss
   their thoughts on example documents or share other information with the class. Some instructors
   make participation in discussions a required component for final grades.</p>
