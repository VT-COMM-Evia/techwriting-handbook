  <div class="p">While the medium through which you deliver a lecture will likely depend on the <a class="xref" href="../resources/tools_resources.html#concept_qjg_rxp_rw" title="Because this course is conducted online, instructors must be comfortable with the online tools and resources that support virtual classroom activities.">resources</a> you have
      available to create the lecture, it is important to remember that the lecture should be
      dictated based on the needs of the concepts being taught. For example, some elements of
      punctuation and grammar may be easily taught and learned through a written document (delivered
      as a PDF). However, such concepts as rhetorical situation may be better delivered as a <a class="xref" href="../resources/elearning_dev_program.html#concept_vnz_jwc_dx" title="E-learning development programs such as Adobe Captivate and Techsmith Camtasia allow instructors to build and deliver lesson modules in a multimedia format.">screencast or
      video</a>. Regardless of the medium, a lecture should be as short as possible (for example,
      a video should be no longer than six minutes) and thus should cover a specific concept within
      a given topic.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Your lessons do <strong class="ph b">not</strong> have to include only lectures that you create.
        You can integrate written work and videos from other sources if you believe they are
        effective for the material being taught. However, it is important to ensure all material
        (including material from external sources) is <a class="xref" href="../disabilities/accessibilty_disabilities.html#concept_ulm_ywp_rw" title="Instructors must ensure all content in their virtual class is accessible to any student with a disability or other accessibility concerns.">accessible</a>
