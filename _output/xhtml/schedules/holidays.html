      <p class="p">University holidays during the <a class="xref" href="regular_semester.html#concept_ilt_mjk_sw" title="Regular semesters are the standard spring and fall semesters, which last 15 weeks.">regular semester</a> often fall on a Monday, making Tuesday the better day for posting
        weekly lessons. In general, if any lesson-posting day falls on a university holiday, the
        lesson should be posted the next day the university is open. No lessons are posted for
        week-long breaks such as Thanksgiving and spring break. Snow days are <strong class="ph b">not</strong> university
        holidays, and lessons therefore should be posted even if the university closes for snow or
        other reasons.</p>

    <div class="section" id="concept_xx2_llk_sw__section_brn_hvd_lx"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Summer Session Holidays</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Typically, the only holiday to manage during the <a class="xref" href="summer_session.html#concept_r31_pjk_sw" title="There are two summer sessions, each lasting approximately six weeks.">summer sessions</a> is Memorial Day,
        which means simply not posting a lesson on that day. Fourth of July is usually between the
        two summer sessions and therefore does not pose a scheduling issue.</p>

    <div class="section" id="concept_xx2_llk_sw__section_xth_jvd_lx"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Winter Session Holidays</h2>
      
      <p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="winter_session.html#concept_u5b_sjk_sw" title="The winter session is an accelerated three-week period between the fall and spring semesters.">winter session</a> begins after
        Christmas, leaving New Year's Eve and New Year's Day as the only holidays to consider when
        posting lessons. Because of the condensed time period in the winter session, you should post
        a lesson on New Year's Eve (assuming it falls on a weekday), allowing you the flexibility to
        skip a posting on New Year's Day (recommended). If New Year's Day falls on a weekday and you
        skip posting a lesson, you may have to post a lesson on a Saturday to fit all 15 lessons
        into the semester. </p>
