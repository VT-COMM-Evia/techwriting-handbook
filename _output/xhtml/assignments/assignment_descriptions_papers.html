  <p class="p">Papers are graded <a class="xref" href="assignment_descriptions.html#concept_rfl_wzp_rw" title="While instructors are free to administer assignments they deem appropriate for their classes, there are different categories of assignments that typically work well for this course.">assignments</a>, but they do not carry as much weight as the larger <a class="xref" href="assignment_descriptions_projects.html#concept_qsg_ddr_dx" title="Projects are long, formal documents that require students not only to write a substantial document that demonstrates their understanding of a specific genre, but also to perform thorough research that supports their document.">projects</a>. As such,
      the grade weight for all papers could be equivalent to the grade weight of one major project,
      which means allocating a smaller percentage to each paper. For example, if major projects are
      each worth 15% of the final grade, you could assign three papers that are collectively worth
      15% of the final grade (5% for each paper).</p>
