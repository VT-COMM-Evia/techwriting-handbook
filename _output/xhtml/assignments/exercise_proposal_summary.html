 <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Exercise: Proposal Summary</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This exercise has students take the details from a complete proposal, and condense them
  into one short summary that could appear on the proposal's title page.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Purpose:</strong> Have students think about the components of a proposal and practice condensing
   content down to a bare minimum.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Summary:</strong> Based on details from a proposal, students must write a short summary that
   highlights all aspects of the proposal. Before posting this exercise, you must have an example
   prepared to give students after they complete the exercise so that they can compare their
   results. The example below includes a corresponding summary that could be used as the
   solution.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Corresponding Lesson Topic:</strong> Proposals.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Grading Guidelines:</strong> Ensure students did not write more than 250 words and that they
   covered all aspects of the proposal. Students can self-correct this exercise against a model that
   instructors post.</p>

  <div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Description for Students</h2>
   
   <p class="p">Write a summary for a proposal based on the following key points:</p>

   <ul class="ul" id="concept_upf_vgs_bx__ul_bvt_n3s_bx">
    <li class="li">
     <p class="p">You are proposing to manufacture a computer processor that can save a laptop manufacturer
      $250,000/year in expenses.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="li">
     <p class="p">The total cost you would have to charge to manufacturer is $500,000.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="li">
     <p class="p">Your proposed duration for the project is one year.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="li">
     <p class="p">Feel free to invent any other relevant facts.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="li">This exercise should really be one short paragraph.</li>

    <li class="li">
     <p class="p">Do not be concerned with visual design, only the quality of the written content. </p>

    </li>

   </ul>

   <p class="p">After you finish, upload your brief summary as a <strong class="ph b">PDF</strong>. A model example will be available
    to you after the exercise deadline so that you can compare to your own work.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Possible Solution</h2>
   
   <p class="p">In response to your RFP, Ace Industries is offering our 20 years of digital manufacturing
    experience to supply ABC Electronics with a new computer processor that will save you $250,000
    per year in laptop manufacturing costs. We are prepared to begin the project as soon as March 1,
    2016 and can have the processor ready for distribution by March 1, 2017. The total cost for
    fulfillment would be $500,000, which you would recognize in savings in only two years.</p>
