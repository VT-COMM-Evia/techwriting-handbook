 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A recommended method for ensuring students with disabilities can understand the contents
  of lectures and other audio/video presentations is to provide the complete script used for
  creating those presentations.</p>

  <p class="p">While planning a lecture or other content for an audio/video presentation, you should write a
   script for all of the actions and words you intend to include in the presentation. Though
   somewhat time consuming to write, such scripts offer important benefits. First, they benefit you
   by reducing the time to record presentations and minimizing errors during recording. More
   importantly, scripts provide a resource for students with hearing or vision disabilities to
   understand the content of the audio/video presentation. Students with hearing disabilities will
   be able to read the script to understand the content being spoken in the presentation. Students
   with vision disabilities can use a screen reader to read the content to them, allowing them to
   know what actions are happening in a video presentation.</p>
