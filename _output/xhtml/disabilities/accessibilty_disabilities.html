All teaching materials that include visual content, must be accessible to students with   visual disabilities.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../disabilities/captions.html">Closed Captions</a></strong><br />
All teaching materials that include sound, such as screencasts and other videos, must be   closed captioned to ensure students with hearing disabilities have access to the audible   content.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../disabilities/scripts.html">Scripts for Audio and Video Presentations</a></strong><br />
A recommended method for ensuring students with disabilities can understand the contents   of lectures and other audio/video presentations is to provide the complete script used for   creating those presentations.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../disabilities/other_disabilities.html">Other Considerations</a></strong><br />
Students with disabilities must provide instructors with documentation from the Services   for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office. If a student provides documentation for a disability,   and you are unsure how to manage it. Contact the SSD office for assistance.</li>
