 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">All teaching materials that include sound, such as screencasts and other videos, must be
  closed captioned to ensure students with hearing disabilities have access to the audible
  content.</p>

  <p class="p">While videos and screencasts are effective modes for delivering lectures online, remember that
   students with hearing disabilities will only see the content and not be able to hear the
   corresponding audio. While adding text inside the video itself is useful in helping such students
   understand the video's content, you must provide closed captions in the video to allow students
   to read the words that are spoken in the video.</p>
