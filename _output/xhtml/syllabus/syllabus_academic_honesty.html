<p class="p">The Undergraduate Honor Code
    pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="q">"As a
     Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
     steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</span></p>
<p class="p">Students enrolled in this
    course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the
    Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the
    course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does
    not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the
    Honor Code.</p>
