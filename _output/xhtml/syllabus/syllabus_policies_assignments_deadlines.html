     Deadlines</a> section contains the date and time each writing assignment is due (including
    workshops). Deadlines for tests and quizzes are posted with each test/quiz in Canvas and are
    also listed with their corresponding assignment due dates in the <a class="xref" href="syllabus_schedule.html#concept_scv_hm4_1y" title="The syllabus should include a comprehensive schedule that explains the date and topics for each lesson.">Schedule</a> section. Deadlines for

   <p class="p">Canvas stops allowing assignment uploads at the deadline for the assignment. All deadline date
    and times are based on the <strong class="ph b">eastern time zone</strong>. Do not wait until the last minute to submit
    your assignment, as you never know when a slow network connection or other problem might cause
    your submission to miss the deadline.</p>

   <p class="p">If you have a problem accessing Canvas, I will allow you to email the assignment to me. In
    such a case, I will use the time I receive your email to determine whether or not an assignment
    has met its deadline.</p>
