 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The syllabus should include a comprehensive schedule that explains the date and topics
  for each lesson.</p>

  <div class="p">
   <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You should also consider using a <a class="xref" href="../quickrefs/quick_refs.html#concept_umd_y1q_rw" title="Quick references provide a brief one or two-page schedule for students to quickly see time-related issues such as lesson postings, quiz deadlines, and assignment postings.">quick reference schedule</a> as a
    separate reference document for students in addition to the comprehensive schedule you include
    in your syllabus.</div>

  </div>

  <div class="p">The relevant information for the schedule includes:<ul class="ul" id="concept_scv_hm4_1y__ul_drb_z43_1y">
    <li class="li">A general explanation on how the schedule works</li>

    <li class="li">A breakdown of the dates and topics for each lesson in the course</li>

   </ul>
</div>

  <div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Schedule</strong></p>
<p class="p">The schedule in this section highlights
    the preparation, readings, quizzes/tests, topics, and work due for each class lesson of the
    semester. You can also keep an eye on upcoming project, paper, and test deadlines by referring
    to the <a class="xref" href="syllabus_deadlines.html#concept_rk3_g4b_hx" title="Although instructors likely have deadlines posted in a semester calendar, it is useful for students to see deadlines as they apply to their graded papers and projects.">Writing Assignment
     Deadlines</a> section. Exercises are considered part of the classwork and are thus not
    listed here as deadlines.</p>
 So that class lessons are meaningful, and so that you will have
   thoughts or questions to contribute, you must complete the corresponding preparation, readings,
   and quizzes <strong class="ph b">before</strong> the class. These items are listed under <strong class="ph b">Due</strong> for the
   corresponding class. Always look at due items well in advance of the lesson to give yourself
   adequate time to prepare and take quizzes prior to that lesson.</div>
