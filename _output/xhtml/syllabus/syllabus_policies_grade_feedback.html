   <p class="p">As you will discover in this course, no formula exists that can be applied to a technical
    document to determine its quality. For example, a technical document could have useful and
    accurate content, but it would be all for naught if the document were riddled with numerous
    grammatical errors and typos that made it too distracting to read. Therefore, grades for papers
    and projects are based on the total overall reading experience, considering the following
    factors (in no specific order):</p>

   <ul class="ul" id="concept_w1x_cx3_1y__ul_h2s_xx4_1y">
    <li class="li">Substance and conventions of the genre based on class lessons and textbook readings</li>

    <li class="li">Required content as specified in the assignment description</li>

    <li class="li">Grammar, spelling, and typographical errors</li>

    <li class="li">Quality of writing and appropriate use of lists, tables, and other content structures</li>

    <li class="li">Appropriateness to the document’s applicable audience</li>

    <li class="li">Information design and flow of prose/exposition, including use of headings and
     subheadings</li>

    <li class="li">Professional tone</li>

    <li class="li">Page and graphic design, images, and other graphical aids</li>

   </ul>

   <p class="p">Just as you submit projects and papers electronically, I will return grades, corrections, and
    notes on them electronically unless I specify otherwise in class.</p>
