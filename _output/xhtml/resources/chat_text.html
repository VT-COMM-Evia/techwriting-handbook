 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A texting app such as Skype allows you to communicate with students by sending text
  messages to one another real-time.</p>

  <p class="p">A texting app allows you to start a text-based conversation with a student and then continue
   the conversation at a later time if necessary, unlike <a class="xref" href="chat_voice.html#concept_zky_cjq_dx" title="Voice chat allows you to communicate directly with students real-time.">voice</a> or <a class="xref" href="chat_video.html#concept_yfr_djq_dx" title="Much like students in a traditional course can visit their instructor face-to-face during office hours, students in a virtual course can meet face-to-face with their instructor in a virtual environment.">video</a> chats, which typically require a
   synchronous conversation throughout the entire meeting. Texting apps typically allow you to
   archive text conversations so that you can refer to it at a later time. <a class="xref" href="https://www.skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a> is a useful texting app
   because it also facilitates voice and video chat should you decide to switch to that mode of
   conversation. Skype also allows you to interact with multiple people simultaneously if you need
   to meet with workgroups.</p>
