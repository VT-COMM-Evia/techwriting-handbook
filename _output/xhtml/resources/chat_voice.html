  <p class="p">Engaging in voice chat with students can be as simple as allowing them to call you at your
   office phone during established hours. However, because using your office phone requires that you

   (for example, a website or a student's paper) while engaged in the chat session. <a class="xref" href="https://webex.tlos.vt.edu/" target="_blank">WebEx</a>, despite being
   primarily for full conferencing, also facilitates voice chat and supports screen sharing.</p>
