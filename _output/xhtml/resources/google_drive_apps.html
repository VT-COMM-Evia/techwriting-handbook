  <p class="p">All Virginia Tech students and faculty have a free academic account for storing files and
   collaborating on projects online through <a class="xref" href="google_drive.html#concept_hqg_ddd_dx" title="Google Drive provides a place for students and faculty to save content in the cloud and then share that content (or collaborate on it) with others to whom they give permission.">Google
    Drive</a> and apps. Google apps are particularly useful for students to collaborate with one
   another and for instructors to work directly with students real time in an online environment.
   For example, students might have to work on a group project to write a report. They can store the
   report and supporting project files on Google Drive, and use <a class="xref" href="google_docs.html#concept_gmt_hdd_dx" title="Google Docs allows students to write and format documents, share content, and collaborate with instructors and other students real time in an online environment.">Google Docs</a> to write the document and
   collaborate on it real time in an online environment. Similarly, instructors can work directly on
   a document in Google Docs with a student. </p>
