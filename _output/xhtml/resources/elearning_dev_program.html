 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">E-learning development programs such as Adobe Captivate and Techsmith Camtasia allow
  instructors to build and deliver lesson modules in a multimedia format.</p>

  <p class="p">Although you will have textbooks, articles, and other reading material to assign as part of
   your class curriculum, students will expect a component that <a class="xref" href="../coursecomponents/lectures.html#concept_vqp_xyp_rw" title="A lecture is the method through which instructors teach specific concepts of a given topic. When delivered through an online course, lectures are synonymous with tutorials.">delivers lessons to them much like a
    lecture</a> in a traditional face-to-face classroom. While you might share PDFs or links to
   online articles for students to read as part of a lesson, students will quickly become bored if
   all of their lessons consist of nothing but reading.</p>

  <div class="p">An e-learning development program allows you to create tutorials and short lectures in which
   you deliver lesson components to students in a multimedia platform. For example, you might create
   an audio/video clip in which you talk to the student about a report type while showing an example
   of the report in the video. Such a clip might also include interaction with the student that has
   them, for example, answer a few quiz questions before continuing with the lesson. At a minimum,
   you can use e-learning development programs to create a screencast in which you speak while
   showing corresponding slides on the screen.<div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> When creating tutorial and
    lecture clips, be sure to account for students who have <a class="xref" href="../disabilities/accessibilty_disabilities.html#concept_ulm_ywp_rw" title="Instructors must ensure all content in their virtual class is accessible to any student with a disability or other accessibility concerns.">disabilities or other
     accessibility concerns</a>.</div>

  <p class="p">Two common e-learning development programs are <a class="xref" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html" target="_blank">Adobe
    Captivate</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html" target="_blank">Techsmith Camtasia</a>. If you do not want to purchase your own copy of such
   a program, <a class="xref" href="../about/about_definitions.html#concept_ldw_hrk_sw__termTLOS">TLOS</a>
   has these tools installed on computers that are available for instructors to use. TLOS will also
   help you get started working with the tools and creating lessons. You can obtain more information
   about TLOS classes at <a class="xref" href="https://tlos.vt.edu/" target="_blank">https://tlos.vt.edu/</a>. You can also access tutorials for working with these tools at
    <a class="xref" href="http://www.olcs.lt.vt.edu/lynda/" target="_blank">Lynda.com</a>
   (available to Virginia Tech faculty and students for free).</p>
