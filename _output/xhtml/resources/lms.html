  (LMS).</p>

  <p class="p">While traditional face-to-face classes also use an LMS to support class activities, an LMS is
   critical to the success of a virtual class. Without a well-structured and organized LMS, students
   would have a difficult time conducting studies and performing the required tasks for the course.
   The LMS functions as the repository and central access point for all of the <a class="xref" href="../coursecomponents/course_components.html#concept_j2p_2yp_rw" title="Course components are the topic lectures, assignments, quizzes, and other resources that comprise the complete virtual classroom for this course.">course components</a>.
   Students use the LMS to access all of the <a class="xref" href="../lessons/lesson_descriptions.html#concept_wk5_lkc_bx" title="Lessons are sets of one or more course topics, delivered in online postings over the entire semester. While instructors are free to arrange lessons as they deem appropriate for their classes, the lessons provided here typically work well for this course and can serve as a starting point. At a minimum, you should ensure your lessons meet the lesson objectives specified here.">lessons</a> and <a class="xref" href="../assignments/assignment_descriptions.html#concept_rfl_wzp_rw" title="While instructors are free to administer assignments they deem appropriate for their classes, there are different categories of assignments that typically work well for this course.">assignments</a> that
   comprise the entire course.</p>

  <p class="p">All instructors have an account in Canvas, which is Virginia Tech's supported LMS (<a class="xref" href="../about/contacts_roles.html#reference_m1y_rkw_rw" title="This table provides a list of contacts and their roles relevant to teaching this course.">contact</a> the Director of
   Professional and Technical Writing if you do not have an account). You can access Canvas at <a class="xref" href="https://canvas.vt.edu/" target="_blank">https://canvas.vt.edu/</a>. </p>

  <p class="p">Canvas automatically adds classes (called "courses" in Canvas) for the registered instructor to
   edit and publish. This initial course setup includes all of the students registered in the class
   roster. It is up to you to further develop the course and then publish it for students to access.
   Once you have a course set up in Canvas, you can re-use it for future classes.</p>

  <p class="p">The Networked Learning Initiatives (NLI) at Virginia Tech offers classes on Canvas to help any
   instructor who is not familiar with the platform. You can view and register for these NLI classes
   at <a class="xref" href="https://app.nli.tlos.vt.edu/" target="_blank">https://app.nli.tlos.vt.edu/</a>.</p>
