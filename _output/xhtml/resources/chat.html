 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Even though this course is asynchronous and conducted online, instructors can still hold
  virtual office hours or facilitate other meetings (with individual students or workgroups) through
  text, voice, or video chat.</p>

  <div class="p">With the plethora of free chat tools available today, you have many options for engaging in
   direct conversations with remote students. The only requirement is that you select a tool that
   supports multiple device types (laptop, tablet, and phone) so that students can engage in the
   meeting with whichever device type they use. This handbook discusses two preferred chat tools:<ul class="ul" id="concept_tmn_1yp_rw__ul_ogq_wtg_1y">
    <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="https://www.skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a> is free chat
     tool and is typically installed by default on most devices. It allows you to conduct <a class="xref" href="chat_text.html#concept_sk2_cjq_dx" title="A texting app such as Skype allows you to communicate with students by sending text messages to one another real-time.">text</a>, <a class="xref" href="chat_voice.html#concept_zky_cjq_dx" title="Voice chat allows you to communicate directly with students real-time.">voice</a>, and <a class="xref" href="chat_video.html#concept_yfr_djq_dx" title="Much like students in a traditional course can visit their instructor face-to-face during office hours, students in a virtual course can meet face-to-face with their instructor in a virtual environment.">video</a> chat.</li>

    <li class="li">WebEx is a conferencing tool that allows you to hold virtual meetings, teach classes, and
     hold office hours on the Web. Virginia Tech has a WebEx license that allows you to use the tool
     for free. <a class="xref" href="../about/about_definitions.html#concept_ldw_hrk_sw__termTLOS">TLOS</a>
     provides more information about using WebEx at <a class="xref" href="https://webex.tlos.vt.edu/" target="_blank">https://webex.tlos.vt.edu/</a>.</li>
