 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Google Drive provides a place for students and faculty to save content in the cloud and
  then share that content (or collaborate on it) with others to whom they give
  permission.</p>

  <p class="p">Other Google apps (such as <a class="xref" href="google_docs.html#concept_gmt_hdd_dx" title="Google Docs allows students to write and format documents, share content, and collaborate with instructors and other students real time in an online environment.">Google Docs</a>
   and <a class="xref" href="google_slides.html#concept_l2l_pdd_dx" title="Google Slides allows students to create supporting slides for presentations and to collaborate as needed real time in an online environment.">Google Slides</a>) use Google Drive as
   the storage location for content developed with those apps (you can also save content to your
   local computer). Even if students do not want to use Google Drive to share or collaborate on
   content, it is a good (and free) tool for them to back up their work in the class. Since storage
   space is free for Virginia Tech students, you can reasonably require students to maintain backups
   of all their work so that students will not miss assignment deadlines because of data loss on
   their local computer.</p>
