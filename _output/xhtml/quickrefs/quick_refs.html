 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Quick references provide a brief one or two-page schedule for students to quickly see
    time-related issues such as lesson postings, quiz deadlines, and assignment
    postings.</p>

  <p class="p">Because there is no structured class schedule to help students remain organized in a virtual
            classroom, the quick reference helps them remain organized and pay attention to
            deadlines without having to constantly look through the <a class="xref" href="../syllabus/syllabus_components.html#concept_jvk_ssr_dx" title="A comprehensive syllabus should include components that clearly explain to students the policies, deliverables, and schedule for the course.">comprehensive
                syllabus</a>.</p>

  <p class="p">Quick references are based on <a class="xref" href="../schedules/course_schedules.html#concept_ar5_n1q_rw" title="Schedules for this course follow a lesson-based system in which one lesson provides one week's instruction in a regular (fall and spring) semester. Thus, the course contains 15 lessons.">semester</a> type
            (regular semester, summer session, and winter session). These semester types are similar
            in terms of what topics and deadlines are assigned for each lesson; however, they differ
            in how deadlines are assigned based on number of weeks (and therefore lesson frequency)
            in the course. For example, in a regular semester course it is easy to assign students a
            major deadline for the following lesson because that lesson is scheduled for the
            following week. However, the same deadline would be more difficult in a winter session
            because the next lesson could be the very next day.</p>
