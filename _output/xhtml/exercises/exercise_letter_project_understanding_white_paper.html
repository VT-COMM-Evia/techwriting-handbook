  their white paper project.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Purpose:</strong> Have students explain their plans for the <a class="xref" href="../assignments/project_white_paper.html#concept_lw3_ddq_fx" title="This project has students research and write a professional-grade white paper that reflects all major concepts covered in the course.">white paper
                project</a>, providing an opportunity for you to approve projects and work with
            students if necessary to refine their project plans. This exercise also gives students
            practice writing a formal business letter. </p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Summary:</strong> Students must write a formal business letter, in correct business letter
            format, explaining their decision for the white paper project, including the topic and
            thoughts about how they might present the project in an <a class="xref" href="../assignments/presentation_white_paper_topic.html#concept_vdv_zkq_fx" title="This oral presentation has students prepare a video or other digital medium to deliver a presentation on the central topic of their white paper project.">oral
                presentation</a>.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Corresponding Lesson Topics:</strong> White papers; making oral presentations; correspondence
      (specifically letters).</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Grading Guidelines:</strong> Verify the students have written their letter as a real business
      letter in correct letter format. Also make sure the content is clear, concise, persuasive, and
      grammatically correct. Separately, verify that the selected topic is acceptable for the
      project and that the students have thought about the corresponding oral presentation.</p>

  <div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Description for Students</h2>

    This letter must be in <strong class="ph b">standard business letter format</strong>, as covered in our correspondence

    the requirements and banned topics before working on this letter.</p>

   <p class="p">Save the document as a <strong class="ph b">PDF</strong> file, and upload it to this assignment. If I have any issues
    with or questions about your project, I will message you to resolve them.</p>
