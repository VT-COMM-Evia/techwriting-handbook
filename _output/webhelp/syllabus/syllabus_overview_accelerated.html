   <p class="p">The summer session version of this course is intense. To uphold the integrity of the Technical
    Writing course and ensure students receive the instruction they deserve, we cover the same
    content and have the same assignments as the courses conducted during standard semesters. This
    condensed scheduling means we cover a 15-week semester in only 6 short weeksâ€”we have two to
    three class lessons per week, and each of those class lessons represents over two weeks of a
    standard semester. You must ensure you have a large amount of time every day not only for the
    classwork but also for the additional hours of homework, tests, quizzes, and assignments.
    Missing a class lesson is simply not an option to be successful in this version of the course.
    This statement is not intended to scare you away from the course but to prepare you for its
    intense workload.</p>

   <p class="p">The winter session version of this course is intense. To uphold the integrity of the Technical
    Writing course and ensure students receive the instruction they deserve, we cover the same
    content and have the same assignments as the courses conducted during standard semesters. Each
    class in the winter session represents at least one week of a standard semester, and we have a
    class every weekday of the session. This condensed scheduling means that months of work are
    covered in a few short weeks. You must ensure you have a large amount of time every day not only
    for the three plus hours of classwork, but also for the additional hours of homework, quizzes,
    workshops, and assignments. Missing a class lesson is simply not an option to be successful in
    this version of the course. This statement is not intended to scare you away from the course but
    to prepare you for its intense workload.</p>
