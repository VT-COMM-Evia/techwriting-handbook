 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Exercises are low-risk assignments that help students get comfortable with new concepts
  and, in some cases, give students a starting point to build up to the larger papers and projects
  they must submit for grades in the course.</p>

  <p class="p">Because they are low-risk <a class="xref" href="assignment_descriptions.html#concept_rfl_wzp_rw" title="While instructors are free to administer assignments they deem appropriate for their classes, there are several categories of assignments that typically work well for this course.">assignments</a>, exercises typically do not receive an individual grade other than
   "completed" or "not completed." To have their exercise marked as "completed," students must
   demonstrate that they put forth an effort toward accomplishing the goals of the exercise
   (regardless of whether or not they did so correctly).</p>

  <p class="p">Instead of assigning grades for each exercise, you could assign one grade to all exercises
   collectively, basing the grade on the percentage of exercises a student completes at the end of
   the semester. Following this model, the grade weight for all exercises could be equivalent to the
   grade weight of one major <a class="xref" href="assignment_descriptions_projects.html#concept_qsg_ddr_dx" title="Projects are long, formal documents that require students not only to write a substantial document but also to perform thorough research that supports their document.">project</a>. For example, if major projects are each worth 15% of the final grade, then the
   collection of exercises would also be worth 15% of the final grade. If a student were to complete
   80% of assigned exercises, they would receive an 80 as their exercises grade, which would be
   worth 15% of their final grade.</p>
