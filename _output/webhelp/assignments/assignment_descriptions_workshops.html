  <p class="p">Workshops are graded <a class="xref" href="assignment_descriptions.html#concept_rfl_wzp_rw" title="While instructors are free to administer assignments they deem appropriate for their classes, there are different categories of assignments that typically work well for this course.">assignments</a>, but they do not carry as much weight as <a class="xref" href="assignment_descriptions_papers.html#concept_ev5_1dr_dx" title="Papers are short technical documents that students write to demonstrate their understanding of a specific genre and its corresponding concepts.">papers</a> and <a class="xref" href="assignment_descriptions_projects.html#concept_qsg_ddr_dx" title="Projects are long, formal documents that require students not only to write a substantial document that demonstrates their understanding of a specific genre, but also to perform thorough research that supports their document.">projects</a>. As such,
      the grade weight for all workshops could be less than these other assignments. For example, if
      major projects are collectively worth 30% of the final grade and papers are collectively worth
      15% of the final grade, workshops could be collectively worth 10% of the final grade.</p>
