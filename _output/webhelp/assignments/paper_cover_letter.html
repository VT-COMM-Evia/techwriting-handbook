 <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Cover Letter to Support Job Application</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This paper has students write a cover letter that supports a résumé in applying for a
  job based on a specific job posting.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Purpose:</strong> Have students demonstrate what they have learned about correspondence
   (specifically business letters) and job-application materials (specifically cover letters) by
   writing a graded cover letter that supports a résumé in applying for a job.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Summary:</strong> Students must write a cover letter to support a résumé submission to apply for
   a posted job opening (the résumé is not required for this assignment). The cover letter must be
   customized toward one specific job or internship posting that the student finds on their own.
   Students should thus include a copy of the job posting with the cover letter assignment. The
   example assignment below is not paired with a <a class="xref" href="assignment_descriptions_workshops.html#concept_db4_h2r_dx" title="Workshops (peer reviews) require students to review, edit, and provide feedback on written work from fellow students. They typically carry a weight similar to papers.">workshop</a>; however, you
   could integrate this cover letter with an assignment that integrates a mock interview based on
   the cover letter. </p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Corresponding Lesson Topics:</strong> Job-application materials; correspondence (specifically
   letters).</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Grading Guidelines:</strong> Ensure the student has written their letter as a real business
   letter in correct letter format, preferably one that matches their résumé such that they are able
   to "brand" themselves. It should be addressed to the organization that posted the job, preferably
   to a specific person based on the student's research into the company (for example, it could be
   addressed to the hiring manager). The content in the letter must be clear, concise, and
   grammatically correct and it should not use cover-letter cliches and buzzwords. It should quickly
   state why the student is writing without starting with a superfluous introduction. The letter
   should persuade the reader by demonstrating how the student's skillset is a good match for the
   specific requirements in the job posting.</p>

  <div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Description for Students</h2>
   
   <p class="p">Write a cover letter (business letter format) that you would include with a résumé to support
    a request for a job interview (do <strong class="ph b">not</strong> include the résumé). This must be based on a
    real-world job posting in your chosen field, whether it is a full-time job or an internship.
    Even if you are not planning to apply for the job, you must still base your letter on a real
    posting. The posting is what will dictate the specific content in your letter. You must include
    a copy of the job posting with the letter.</p>

   <p class="p">This letter is a good place to consider beginning, middle, and end. In other words,
     <strong class="ph b">begin</strong> the letter by telling the reader why you are writing (hook them so that they want
    to know more about why you are the perfect candidate). In the <strong class="ph b">middle</strong>, explain such things
    as your professional and academic background. <strong class="ph b">End</strong> the letter with a quick summary and
    action item (for example, try to get them to contact you for an interview). But don’t be literal
    with “beginning, middle, and end.” It does not necessarily mean there is exactly one paragraph
    for each. Of course, include anything else you believe is pertinent. Again, make it specific to
    your selected job posting.</p>

   <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Requirements</strong></p>

   <div class="p">
    <ul class="ul" id="concept_oqk_pgb_fx__ul_rj3_3pt_2x">
     <li class="li">Post the final document here as a <strong class="ph b">PDF</strong> file. Employers and clients will typically
      expect deliverables to be submitted in a format that they prefer. So it's good to get used to
      submitting to a defined standard. If you submit the document as a Word file or any format
      other than PDF, I will deduct points and ask you to resubmit.</li>

     <li class="li">Do <strong class="ph b">not</strong> include your résumé. This assignment is for your cover letter only.</li>

     <li class="li">Include a copy of your selected job posting (scanned copy, screenshot, or copied and pasted
      from original). The easiest way to do this is to just add it as an additional page to the PDF
      you are uploading. I will use the information in the posting to gauge how well you framed the
      content in your letter.</li>

     <li class="li">Be sure to use complete and correct business letter formatting, as covered in our lesson
      and textbook. Similarly, be sure to use real information in your address sections. This might
      mean you have to conduct some research to find the recipient’s address (just like you would
      have to do for a real-world cover letter). If you are uncomfortable including your own home
      contact information in the letter, you can use the address for your academic department. If
      your résumé uses a letterhead, you are welcome (and encouraged) to do so for this paper.</li>

     <li class="li">Focus on the grammar, writing style, and consistency like we covered in the initial
      classes. Avoid job-application clichés and buzzwords. This will all be part of your
      grade.</li>

     <li class="li">This list does not include an explanation of the content you should include or how you
      should include it in the document. That's what our reading assignments and class lessons are
      for. The objective here is to apply what you have learned about the genre.</li>

    </ul>

   <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cover Letter Guidelines</strong></p>

   <ul class="ul" id="concept_oqk_pgb_fx__ul_hw5_2qt_2x">
    <li class="li">Using the example formats from the book and class lesson, the letter should be one page (not
     a half page, not two pages).</li>

    <li class="li">Use your selected job posting as a guide for the content in your cover letter. Each cover
     letter you will ever write should be specific to a specific job posting you are pursuing. Make
     sure you sell yourself based on the specific job posting requirements.</li>

    <li class="li">Look at the content and examples in the textbook for formatting your cover letter like a
     business letter. Consider using the same letterhead from your résumé to "brand" yourself.</li>

    <li class="li">After you write the document, be sure to revise it, edit it, re-edit it, and re-edit it
     again. If I see a simple typo, it probably means you didn't spend much time editing the
     document. <strong class="ph b">Here's a great tip:</strong> Read the finished document out loud as if you were reading
     it to an audience; any typos or errors will become very obvious to you.</li>

   </ul>

   <ul class="ul" id="concept_oqk_pgb_fx__ul_iw5_2qt_2x">
    <li class="li">Remember your audience (the prospective employer). You need to sell them on why you are the
     perfect candidate for the job.</li>

   </ul>
