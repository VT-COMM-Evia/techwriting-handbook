            their classes, there are different categories of assignments that typically work well
            for this course.</p>

            <p class="p">The assignments discussed in this section support the suggested <a class="xref" href="../lessons/lesson_descriptions.html#concept_wk5_lkc_bx" title="Lessons are sets of one or more course topics, delivered in online postings over the entire semester.

                  for this course. While there is not a matching assignment for every lesson
                  described in this handbook, the assignments discussed here provide a balance of
                  student work across most of the course lessons.</p>

            <p class="p">Because this course is delivered online, it is critical to provide detailed
                  instructions for students to complete each assignment. The assignments provided
                  here include suggested descriptions that you can use as is or modify as
                  needed.</p>

<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../assignments/assignment_descriptions_papers.html">Papers</a></strong><br />
Papers are short technical documents that students write to demonstrate their   understanding of the corresponding concepts.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../assignments/assignment_descriptions_projects.html">Projects</a></strong><br />
Projects are long, formal documents that require students not only to write a   substantial document but also to perform thorough research that supports their   document.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../assignments/assignment_descriptions_workshops.html">Workshops</a></strong><br />
Workshops (peer reviews) require students to review, edit, and provide feedback on   written work from fellow students. They typically carry a weight similar to papers.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../assignments/assignment_descriptions_presentations.html">Oral Presentations</a></strong><br />
Oral presentations require students to present the highlights of their work from select   projects. Because this course is online, oral presentations are usually in video or a similar   digital format.</li>
