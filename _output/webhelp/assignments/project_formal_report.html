 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This project has students work in a group to research and write a proposal and/or a
  recommendation report.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Purpose:</strong> Have students demonstrate what they have learned about audience assessment,
   research, and the proposal and recommendation report genres by working in a group to research and
   write a graded proposal and/or recommendation report genres. This project also gives students
   practice working on writing projects as part of a project group.</p>

  <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">Summary:</strong> Students must work in a project group to research and write a formal proposal
   or recommendation report that is related to their academic disciplines. Before posting this
   exercise, you must place students into project groups (these are the same groups as for the <a class="xref" href="../exercises/exercise_letter_project_understanding_report.html#concept_znd_3qs_bx" title="This exercise has students work together in their project group to write a business letter that explains their decisions for their formal report project.">letter
    of project understanding</a>, <a class="xref" href="../exercises/exercise_audience_assessment.html#concept_ry5_3fz_bx" title="This exercise has students work together in their project group to perform a complete assessment of the audience(s) of their formal report project.">audience
    assessment</a>, and <a class="xref" href="../exercises/exercise_research_sources.html#concept_gvm_khz_bx" title="This exercise has students work together in their project group to perform a complete assessment of research they must perform for their project.">research sources</a>
   exercises). The groups should be organized based on academic discipline so that students can
   write on a subject related to their discipline (depending on the variety of majors in the class,
   this might not be possible for all students). The example below assumes you used
    <strong class="ph b">Collaborations</strong> in Canvas to group students. An alternative to this project could be to
   have the groups write <strong class="ph b">both</strong> documents (proposal <strong class="ph b">and</strong> recommendation report), for
   which you could divide the grade between the two deliverables. Using this model, you could have
   the students first write a proposal to propose the creation of their recommendation reports. Once
   the proposal is approved, students could then continue with the corresponding recommendation
   report. The example below has students choose one document <strong class="ph b">or</strong> the other. To help students
   understand the assignment's expectations, you should have one or more examples of both a proposal
   and a recommendation report posted with the assignment page (the example assignment description
   below assumes you have posted examples).<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> Historically, students often select
    topics that can be common and overused. You should include a list of "banned topics" to force
    students to find topics that are more original. The example below includes a list of common
    topics that should be banned. Forcing students to select a topic from their academic discipline
    will also help in forcing them to remain original.</div>
</div>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Corresponding Lesson Topics:</strong> Proposals; recommendation reports; graphical aids; page
   layout and visual design.</p>

  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Grading Guidelines:</strong> The paper should be formal in both document format and content tone
   and should contain the appropriate sections for their genre. Research for the paper must be
   thorough and accurate. For a proposal, the document should be persuasive and must demonstrate
   that the proposed action or deliverable is worth the investment being sought. For a
   recommendation report, the document should clearly recommend either solutions to solve a problem
   or actions to capitalize on an opportunity. Content for either genre should be clear, concise,
   and grammatically correct and should be understandable for the intended audience. In addition to
   grading the paper itself, you should ensure the students were able to collaborate in a
   cooperative manner and contributed to the project equally. Assuming all students in a project
   group contributed equally, they all receive the same grade. However, deductions are appropriate
   for students who are known to contribute less.</p>

  <div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Description for Students</h2><p class="p">With your assigned group, research and write a
    professional-grade proposal or recommendation report. The subject matter of the proposal or
    recommendation report is up to you, preferably something related to your discipline.</p>
<div class="p">Use
    these steps to work with your group:<ol class="ol" id="concept_fjg_crp_fx__ol_qw5_kvr_bx">
     <li class="li">Use the <strong class="ph b">Collaborations</strong> menu to identify the members in your assigned group (these
      should be the same members from the group exercises related to this project), and put a plan
      together to work with each other. We are all working at our own time and pace in this online
      course, so be courteous with one another so one person isn't doing all the work. You should
      reach out to your team <strong class="ph b">immediately</strong> and respond to questions and requests quickly
      throughout the project. If you are unable to reach a person on your team, or if anyone on your
      team is not participating, let me know as soon as possible so that I can help remedy the
      situation.</li>

     <li class="li">Share documents with your group using whatever means you agree to. Canvas works best with
      Google Drive, through which you can author your document in Google Docs.</li>

     <li class="li">When your group is finished, save the document as a <strong class="ph b">PDF</strong> file, and upload it to this
      assignment.</li>

     <li class="li">If I have any issues with or questions about your project, I will message your team to
      resolve them.</li>

    </ol>
</div>

   <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Note:</strong> When conducting research on the Internet, it's easy to be tempted to copy
    material as it exists on websites. Resist any such temptation to copy content from the Internet.
    Researching material on the Internet is completely acceptable (and encouraged); however, content
    you submit for assignments must be completely original.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Topics You Cannot Use</strong></p>
<div class="p">You <strong class="ph b">cannot</strong> use the same topics that are provided
    in the examples attached to this assignment. Additionally, there are a few other topics that you
    cannot use for your report because they either have been overused or are not issues that can be
    solved through a report:<ul class="ul" id="concept_fjg_crp_fx__ul_u5f_gzp_fx">
     <li class="li">Traffic and parking issues at VT (overused topic)</li>

     <li class="li">Issues related to Blacksburg Transit (overused topic)</li>

     <li class="li">Dining services or facilities issues at VT (overused topic and likely too large for a
      report of this size)</li>

     <li class="li">Converting from dirty to clean energy (too large for a report of this size)</li>

     <li class="li">Topics defending illegal activities (inappropriate for this project)</li>

     <li class="li">Political, social, or legal topics such as healthcare or legalization of drugs (not
      solvable through this type of report)</li>

    </ul>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Teamwork</strong></p>
<div class="p">This project is about not only demonstrating your knowledge of
    the genre but also learning how to collaborate on writing projects as a team, which is a common
    practice in many professional settings. With teamwork being the theme, keep in mind the
    following points:<ul class="ul" id="concept_fjg_crp_fx__ul_cgr_nzp_fx">
     <li class="li">Unless I find issues with teammate participation or related problems, the entire group
      receives the same grade for the project.</li>

     <li class="li">If a teammate is not contributing, it is up to the rest of the group to communicate with
      the person about their lack of participation. If your attempt to fix the situation does not
      help, then it is up to you to contact me to help correct the situation.</li>

    </ul>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Requirements</strong></p>
<div class="p">
    <ul class="ul" id="concept_fjg_crp_fx__ul_rj3_3pt_2x">
     <li class="li">Determine the correct report type for your chosen subject matter (proposal or
      recommendation report). Part of this project is to show that you understand the formal report
      genres by selecting the correct report type for your project. If you are unclear about this
      after we finish our lessons on formal reports, then let me know. I will not flat out tell you
      which one to write based on your topic (again figuring it out is part of the project), but I
      can help you to make sure you understand how to differentiate between the report types.</li>

     <li class="li">Post the final document here as a <strong class="ph b">PDF</strong> file. Employers and clients will typically
      expect deliverables to be submitted in a format that they prefer. So it's good to get used to
      submitting to a defined standard. If you submit the document as a Word file or any format
      other than PDF, I will deduct points and ask you to resubmit.</li>

     <li class="li">Include at least one original, quality illustration that supports and supplements your
      narrative. <strong class="ph b">This is an illustration you create, not something you copy from another
       source.</strong> Base it on a critical piece of information from your report. If you conducted an
      important survey that the outcome of your report depends on, create a chart to show the data
      to the reader. In your report, you would describe the critical information so that the
      narrative supports it. For example, if you were showing a pie chart of a company’s quarterly
      revenues, you would write a narrative that explains the revenues: what about their revenues is
      important, why are you showing the chart, is there something specific the reader should focus
      on? Be sure to refer to the figure (for example, the figure number) in the report narrative.
      You never want an illustration that has no reference to it in the document’s narrative
      (otherwise, why would you be including the illustration?).</li>

     <li class="li">Your report will be based on real research. You must have multiple sources of research,
      including at least one source of primary research.</li>

     <li class="li">Focus on the grammar, writing style, and consistency like we covered in the initial
      classes. Also, use the correct format, style, and grammar for writing instructions as covered
      in the lesson on instructions. This will all be part of your grade.</li>

     <li class="li">In our lecture and textbook reading, we talk about a request for proposal (RFP). You are
      free to write a proposal that is based on an RFP. This means that your proposal will have to
      follow the requirements of the corresponding RFP. If you use an RFP, I will need a copy of it
      to help me as I review your project.</li>

     <li class="li">These requirements do not include an inventory of the sections you should include in your
      report. That's what our reading assignments and class lessons are for. The objective here is
      to apply what you have learned about the genre.</li>

    </ul>

   </div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Formal Report Guidelines</strong></p>
<ul class="ul" id="concept_fjg_crp_fx__ul_hw5_2qt_2x">
    <li class="li">The report will probably need to be around 2,000 to 3,000 efficient words. I say “efficient”
     words because technical writing should be as concise as possible. The goal is great content,
     not number of words. Page count is not really a good measure because formatting, white space,
     illustrations, and other factors influence page count as much as words do. Also, you might have
     research and supplemental data to include in appendixes, which can take up pages (and which you
     should not consider as part of your word count).</li>

    <li class="li">After you write the document, be sure to revise it, edit it, re-edit it, and re-edit it
     again. If I see a simple typo, it probably means you didn't spend much time editing the
     document. I recommend leaving time for each teammate to have a round of proofreading and
     edits.</li>

   </ul>
<ul class="ul" id="concept_fjg_crp_fx__ul_iw5_2qt_2x">
    <li class="li">This is not an academic essay, so do not format your document like one. Look at the content
     and examples in the textbook to see how they format a professional-grade report. Also look at
     the sample PDFs of previous formal report projects that are attached to this assignment. Keep
     in mind that the intent with providing examples is not for you to simply copy and replace your
     own text. It’s to give you a feel for how other people approach writing this genre. <strong class="ph b">DO
      NOT</strong> use the attached samples as an exact format for your own document. What these samples
     do not show is any specific feedback I might have provided for errors in format, design, or
     writing. If you simply copy the format of these samples, you may be copying an error that I
     suggested the author fix. Again, the samples are strictly to provide an idea for how others
     approached the paper.</li>

   </ul>
<ul class="ul" id="concept_fjg_crp_fx__ul_jw5_2qt_2x">
    <li class="li">Remember your audience (<strong class="ph b">not</strong> me as the reviewer and grader, but the real audience
     based on your assessment).</li>

    <li class="li">Make it inviting and interesting to look at. This should be something that invites readers
     in and holds their attention. Use the page design concepts we cover in that corresponding
     lesson.</li>
